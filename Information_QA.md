## Answers to questions raised at the information session

### Aquarium COI/12S/16S datasets - Resident species
An extended list of resident species from the aquarium, including whether or not they have sequences in the reference database, was added. While all resident species are represented in the COI database, not all have sequences for the 12S and/or 16S genes.
The list can be found under :file_folder: &nbsp;[**associated_files/aquarium_COI_12S_16S_resident_species_byprimer.xlsx**](https://github.com/marco-bolo/wp2-wp5-workshop/tree/master/associated_files)

### Aquarium COI/12S/16S datasets - Raw sequences
The datasets provided contain the raw, demultplexed sequences but no filtering was applied. 

### Aquarium COI/12S/16S datasets - Potential contaminants
Attached is a list of species confirmed by the aquarium as part of the fish' diet. However, there is no comprehensive list of all the fish used as food. The species listed were identified during the study and confirmed by the aquarium as being part of the fish' diet. The aquarium typically purchases fish for food, such as boxes of mackerel, which may contain other mixed species. Therefore, there isn't an exact list of the species used as food, just an idea of what is typically used, along with other species that may come mixed in without any control.
The list can be found under :file_folder: &nbsp;[**associated_files/aquarium_COI_12S_16S_potential_contaminantSpecies.csv**](https://github.com/marco-bolo/wp2-wp5-workshop/tree/master/associated_files)
